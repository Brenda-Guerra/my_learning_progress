bits = binary digits

store electricity or dont store it = save bits 1 or 0

The computer differentiates the letter A from the number 65 by the
    context of it's use, the type of file that is being used, or more 
    specifically the type of program. For example: for a document .docx,
    or a program like microsoft word it'll recognise it as a letter, 
    for a document like a table, for a program like excel, it will be 
    recognised as a number, and so on. (by the use of ASCII)

Unicode = the mapping of multiple letters, alphabets, characters, symbols 
    and etc. Noting that ASCII uses 8 bits (256 variations) and by using 
    16 bits to represent each character, generates like 65K possibilities.  
    With 32 bits, tho, it creates 4 billion different characters

verbo/actions, making the computer do something = function 

ifs and elses, divisions and  = conditionals, forks in your path

sentences that work together with conditionals and that theirs answers
must be true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0 if you might = booleans 

cicle, loop = do something over and over again

problem solving, or computer science is just a matter of inputs (aka argument) 
    generating outputs, and somewhere in between there is some algorithm (FUNCTION -  
    implementation of an algorithm)

clicking the start triggered a EVENT = graphical or interactive occurence
